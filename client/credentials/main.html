		Someone requests a view containing a credential. The data passed to the view will only contain the id of the credential.
		Once that template is rendered, it requests the full credential from the server and the server determines if the requesting user has the privilege to access it. If the user is permitted, the server returns the full credential and the client replaces the credential field with the full credential
		This separation prevents credentials from being accessed insecurely. While the including collection may be passed to the client, the credential collection will never be and will always rely on access checks
		Access checks are performed when the client requests a credential by its ID. Upon receipt the server findOne`s the credential.
		it checks if the requesting user is in a permitted group and not in a restricted group
