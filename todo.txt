checklist new item isn't working

menu with links to all sites, new site, &c, and select lists of recent sites & clients _above_ top of page so when user scrolls up they're visible

Chrome/Firefox extension that detects if you're on a site that's in the control panel and puts the relevant information under a button

instead of div[data-field=x], just use <x></x>
